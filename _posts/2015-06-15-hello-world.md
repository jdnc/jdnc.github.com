Welcome to my new blog! Over the years, doing Computer Science, has been full of ups and downs - a really handy trick, an exasperating bug that magically vanishes with a single line change, command line fu and various how-to's and how not-to's. Unfortunately I never got around to having all that put up where I could refer to it when I came up again the same wall again. This blog is primarily created to remedy that situation, and to record all the other interesting stuff I will learn along the way. Due this it may seem quite incoherent, and probably naively dumb at times. You are welcome to give it a shot anyways! 

## Why objdump?

First of all let's get clear on the name. I learnt about objdump regretfully quite late ( when  I was interning at Amazon) and it than came back again while taking grad OS at UT Austin. This is a very neat shell command, that will show you the contents of your assembled code ( e.g. a.out ) in all the gory details, you can actually view the segments and all. Its pretty exciting. <a href='http://web.mit.edu/jesstess/'>Jessica McKellar  </a>has a couple of very very useful blogposts that explain this in a fun exercise. Highly recommended :
